🜅luid has three basic mechanics. [[🜅 Tests]] are used to determine the outcome of goals and actions, and to define who gets narrative control when things happen. [[🜅 Taxes]] are used to pay for the costs of special powers and abilities, and to represent the effects of failure and injuries. Finally, [[🜅 Advancement]] describes how entities improve and evolve over the course of play.
